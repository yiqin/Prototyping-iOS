AFNetworking Example

It's primary for API testing. It's used to test Kimono now.


How to Load High Quality Images
===========
Inspired by the tutorial on RayWenderlich
http://www.raywenderlich.com/19788/how-to-use-nsoperations-and-nsoperationqueues


Web Scraper
===========
Based on the support from Kimono. It must be supported by the backend, rather than directly from Kimono to iOS.


FireBase Quickstart
===========
Start to learn FireBase.
