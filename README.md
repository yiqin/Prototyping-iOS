Prototyping

My prototyping project comes here.

Web Scraper
===========
Based on the support from Kimono. It must be supported by the backend, rather than directly from Kimono to iOS.

Working with Block
===========
Blocks are also used for callbacks, defining the code to be executed when a task completes.
Inspired by the tutorial on RayWenderlich
http://www.raywenderlich.com/9438/how-to-use-blocks-in-ios-5-tutorial-part-2

NOTE: Blocks are Objective-C objects, which means they can be added to collections like NSArray or NSDictionary. They also have the ability to capture values from the enclosing scope, making them similar to closures or lambdas in other programming languages.

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks
